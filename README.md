# Fibonacci
Fibonacci Assignment from COMP 352 Concordia


In this programming assignment, you will implement in Java both the versions of Fibonacci calculators and experimentally 
compare their runtime performances. For that, with each implemented version you will calculate Fibonnaci (5), Fibonacci (10), 
etc. in increments of 5 up to Fibonacci (100) (or higher value if required for your timing measurement) and measure the 
corresponding run times. You need to use Javaâ€™s built-in time function for this purpose. You should redirect the output 
of each program to an out.txt file. You should write about your observations on timing measurements in a separate text 
or pdf file.

The two types are:
Fibonacci through tail-recursion and fibonacci through linear-recursion
